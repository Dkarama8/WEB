                <p>The iPhone 13 Pro Max is what happens when you get practically everything you could want in a phone. This premium flagship (from $1,099) packs a 
                    120Hz refresh rate display, the fastest performance of any handset and epic battery life.
                    But it’s the iPhone 13 Pro Max's cameras that put this phone over the top, as they're the best I've tested on a phone so far. You can shoot 
                    Cinematic mode videos with a compelling bokeh effect, choose your own Photographic styles and take super 
                    close-up shots with a new macro mode that leverages the ultra-wide camera. The iPhone 13 Pro Max’s camera bump is definitely more prominent this
                    time around, thanks to the larger sensors, and the overall design is heftier than the iPhone 12 Pro Max. But I do like that the notch on the 6.7-inch display is 
                    smaller. Check out our iPhone 13 Pro review if you want all the same features in a more compact and slightly less expensive phone. If you're looking for something 
                    more affordable and don't need a telephoto lens or 120Hz display, check out our iPhone 13 review and iPhone 13 mini review. 
                    While I wish Apple offered faster charging and Touch ID, as you’ll see in my full iPhone 13 Pro Max review, this is the best iPhone — and best phone period. The iPhone 13 
                    Pro Max is available to buy right now, starting at $1,099 for 128GB of storage. Going up to 256GB costs $1,199, 512GB is $1,399 and the whopping 1TB option is priced at a gulp-inducing $1,599.
                    On the other side of the Atlantic in the U.K., the 128GB iPhone 13 Pro Max starts at £1,049, hitting £1,149 for the 265GB model and £1,349 for the 512GB version. If you have plenty of money to 
                    burn and want a lot of storage, then the 1TB iPhone 13 Pro will cost a wallet-walloping £1,549.                    
                    Note that you can save on the iPhone 13 Pro Max if you trade in your old iPhone or other phone. And we’re tracking the best iPhone 13 deals to help you save some money on this rather pricey Apple phone.
